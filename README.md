Cythesis - C based High Level Synthesis, built on top of the C Intermediate Language (CIL)
============================

Cythesis is a plugin for CIL that allows for high level synthesis to Verilog.

The installation is the same as the original cil repo https://github.com/cil-project/cil, but needs to some extra command line options to run the HLS system.
